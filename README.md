This challenge was my first challenge in my online Bootcamp.
The goal was to show a complex understaing of pseudo classes in HTML, as well as how to design with CSS.

The below is the user story and acceptance criteria I recieved:

User Story:

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


This challenge served as an explosive start to my training in coding and I genuinely look forward to every challenge going forward!
